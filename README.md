# Project Title
**Salary Function**

## Overview
This project is a Python and R program built to load a salary dataset and perform various tasks like data processing, error handling and file handling

## Features
- **Import Data**: I loaded the downloaded data into a pandas data frame
- **Create Employee Function**: I created a python function that accepts an employee name and returns the details of that employee
- **Data Processing with Dictionary**:  I processed the data using a python dictionary and structured the orientation of the output as a list of dictionaries
- **Error Handling**: I created this to handle potential errors to ensure the program runs smoothly.
- **Export Employee Details**: I created a function that export employee details and saves it in a zipped folder named "Employee Profile", based on the employee name provided. In my code, I tried out an example using the employee record of "Emmanuel Michel"
- **Unzip and Display Data with R**: I created a block of R code that can unzip the folder, and display the data in the csv file created in the previous step

## Files Included
- `Salary_Function_Assignment.ipynb`: This is my Python and R implementation of the Salary function.
- `README.md`: This is me providing context on the project and instructions on how to use the code.
- NB : I did NOT ZIP the submission files again because I saw an announcement asking us not to ZIP it again

## Running the Code
- **Python**: 
  - Connect to Google Colab, start a Python runtime, and paste the code or upload the notebook to run it.
  - NB : Only steps one through five are python code and syntax
  
- **R**:
  - On the same file as above in google colab, change the runtime type from Pyhton to R and run the last step which is **Unzip and Display Data with R**
